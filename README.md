# Pathfinding algorithms visualizer

Welcome to my pathfinding algorithm visualizer project, I build this application because I was studied graph and search algorithms and I wanted to practice.
Hope you like it.
You can access it here https://kon9.github.io/pathfinding-algorithms/

## The following algorithms are implementedin the application
•Astar(weighted)

•Dijkstra search algorithm(weighted)

•Depth-first search

•Breadth-first search

•Ida star(weighted)
